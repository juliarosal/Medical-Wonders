            <p class="lead my-1">Although there are still officially various vaccines being used. Its first vaccination campaign began in early December 2020, which 175.3 million vaccines shots had already been distributed since around February 15, 2021. At least seven different injections (from separate platforms) have also been given out. On December 31, 2020.

                <br> <br>
                the World Health Organization (WHO) released an Emergency Use Listing (EUL) for something like the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine (BNT162b2). WHO released EULs for two variants of the AstraZeneca/Oxford COVID-19 vaccine, made mostly by Serum Institute of India and SKBio, on February 15, 2021. WHO released an EUL for the COVID-19 vaccine Ad26.COV2.S, produced by Janssen, on March 12, 2021. (Johnson & Johnson). 
Other vaccine products will be EUL by June, according to the WHO. <br> <br>
WHO provides goods and updates on their regulatory approval results on a daily basis. <br> <br>
Vaccines must always be approved by national authorities, produced to exact specifications, and administered after they have been shown to be effective in treating. WHO is collaborating with allies all over the world to further organize crucial steps to be taken, such as ensuring equitable rights to accessible and reliable COVID-19 vaccines for people around the world who would need vaccinations.

                    <p class="lead my-1">The majority of those who experience symptoms (roughly 80%) recover without the
                        need for hospital care. Around 15% become severely ill, requiring oxygen, and 5%
                        become critically ill, requiring intensive care. <br>

                        shock, thromboembolism, and/or multiorgan failure, including damage to the heart, liver,
                        or kidneys, are all possible causes of death.<br>

                                        <span class="justify">DOH launched these emergency hotlines in partnership with the National Emergency Hotline of the Department of Interior and Local Government (DILG), and PLDT and Smart Communications Inc. With these emergency hotlines, people can request for assistance, if they suspect that they are infected with COVID- 19 or if they are experiencing the symptoms and known exposure to confirmed patients. Information gathered from the emergency calls is transferred to the COVID- 19 Emergency Operations and Center and other relevant agencies for immediate facilitation and response.<br> <br>

                                        Health Secretary Francisco T. Duque III says that, “we are working with both the public and private sectors which can provide the facilities and the technical expertise to address many challenges. The public’s cooperation and patience is needed to allow only important calls, in that way we can provide medical assistance to those who really need it.” <br> <br>
                                        According to Manuel V. Pangilinan the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of PLDT, their collaboration with DOH and 911 is part of their efforts to fight the spread of COVID- 19. With the services they provide to gather information that will help health authorities to give their proper diagnosis and treatment. <br> <br>
                                        According to the Secretary of the Interior and Local Government, the health workers would handle immense tasks and make sacrifices in order to prevent the spread of the COVID- 19, which is why the other sectors of government are in full support of the frontliners.  <br> <br>
                                        This free 24/7 services will be available through 02-894-COVID. Smart and PLDT users will also be able to use the 1555 hotline for free. Thus, subscribers from other networks can access the 1555 hotline once the technical adjustments are completed.
